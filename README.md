To generate Export.log data yourself go to C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts (or DCS.Openbeta) and put the Export.log in there.

Then you just run any mission and it will start generating. Once you exit out of the mission, it will close the file, and you can find it in the DCS\Logs folder. Please note that in MP the server has to allow `LoGetWorldObjects` function and not all do as it allow for cheating.

Please note that if you use SRS you will need the line at the bottom. Removing it breaks SRS. You might need to remove it if SRS is not installed as compile errors result in the Export.log not being run.
