To generate Export.log data yourself go to C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts (or DCS.Openbeta) and put the export.log in there.

Then you just run any mission and it will start generating once you exit it will close the file and you can file it in the DCS\Logs folder. Please note that server has to allow `LoGetWorldObjects` function and not all do as it enables cheating.

Please note that if you use SRS you will need the line at the bottom. Removing it breaks SRS.
